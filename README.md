The virtualization software used here is VirtualBox, and the OS chosen is Debian.

### What is virtualization ?

Virtualization refers to the process of creating a virtual version of something, such as an operating system, server, storage device, or network resource. This allows multiple virtual instances of the same resource to be created and managed, which can improve efficiency, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness in computing environments. For example, a single physical server can be partitioned into multiple virtual servers, each with its own operating system and applications. This enables better utilization of hardware resources and reduces the need for additional hardware. Virtualization is widely used in cloud computing, data centers, and enterprise IT environments.
